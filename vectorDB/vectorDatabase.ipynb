The second part of the course focuses on practical considerations required for applying these techniques to geotechnical problems. It will be concluded by a number of geotechnical applications and case histories.\",\n",
    "    \"Structural fire engineering: The major aims of this course are to introduce to the students the concept of fire safety engineering and design of fire resistant structures. Students will be given opportunities to learn Eurocode for the design of steel and concrete structures under elevated temperature. At the end of this course, students will be able to understand the fire development and predict gas temperature of fire compartment and temperature of structural members in fire condition. With respect to structural design, students will appreciate the special structural actions that occur under elevated temperature and capable of carrying out fire resistance design of simple steel and reinforced concrete members.\",\n",
    "    \"Earth retaining system: Limited by the available space, development in urban areas often requires construction underground or near slopes. Earth retaining systems are the engineering solution to meet this requirement. They are widely used in Hong Kong and elsewhere in site formation, road and building works, slope stabilization, support of excavation, etc. This course expounds different types of retaining walls, assessment of wall stability based on geotechnical principles, and the good practice for designing new walls and dealing with substandard walls. An introduction to unsaturated soils is also given. Through the course, students will consolidate their understanding of geotechnical theories and appreciate their practical application to geotechnical designs\",\n",
    "    \"Geotechnical testing, instrumentation and monitoring: Geotechnical testing aims at understanding the behaviour of geomaterials that engineers are dealing with. A proper instrumentation and monitoring scheme provides crucial information for engineers to judge the effectiveness and safety of the engineering design and construction. This course first provides students advanced knowledge on geotechnical testing from both experimental and theoretical perspectives. Students are required to have hands-on experience on a common geotechnical test – multi-stage triaxial test. Then both practical and theoretical aspects of geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring are addressed.\",\n",
    "    \"Ground improvement: Construction is sometimes needed in ground that has poor strength and stiffness qualities. Improving the ground by reinforcing it or by modifying it can prevent excessive deformations or even failure. This course introduces civil engineering students to ground improvement by modification or reinforcement. At the end of the course, the students will have a good understanding of the different techniques used for ground improvement, and be able to use some of the theory for design.\",\n",
    "    \"Environmental geotechnology: Environmental geotechnology can be defined as an interdisciplinary science which covers soil and rock and their interactions with various environmental cycles, including the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere, as well as the geo-microbiosphere, and human activities, which includes characteristics of tree and vegetation roots and bacterial activities in the subsurface and subsequent response to the engineering behavior of the soil-water system. The objective of the course is to provide the students with exposure to the geotechnical nature of environmental problems through discussions of contaminant transport in porous media and relationship with remediation technologies for hazardous waste sites and discussions of soil properties relative to waste containment systems, soil stability, and permeability. At the end of the course, the students who fulfill the requirements of this course should be able to understand the importance of Geotechnical Engineering related to environmental issues, to perform preliminary designs of different components of a municipal landfill, and to select appropriate remediation technologies for a given contaminated site.\",\n",
    "    \"Advanced structural analysis: The course covers the advanced structural theory, including the theory of elasticity and plasticity, unsymmetrical bending, torsional analysis of thin-walled sections and yield criteria. Matrix method is introduced for static and stability analyses of two-dimensional structures.\",\n",
    "    \"Special environmental engineering project: The primary aim of the project is to give each individual student an opportunity to handle a practical engineering problem related to environmental engineering and to present the findings in a precise and concise report. An important part of the project lies in the way in which the students plan and carry out the task, and apply their knowledge sensibly and diligently to solve the problem. The way in which the students present their findings is equally important.\",\n",

    "    \"Advanced theory and design of structures: The theory part of the course introduces the theory and applications of the matrix method for static and stability analyses of two-dimensional structures together with the elastic and plastic torsional analyses of thin-walled sections. The design part of the course introduces the concept and principles of inelastic design of reinforced concrete structures with emphasis on plastic hinge formation and moment redistribution. On practical design aspects, ultimate limit state design as per Hong Kong Concrete Code of special structural members such as two-way slabs, flat slabs, torsion members and slender columns will be discussed and explained. The course also includes a section of serviceability limit state design of large civil water-retaining reinforced concrete structures, such as underground box culverts, open channels, manholes, inspection chambers and water/sewage treatment tanks.\",\n",
    "    \"Building information modelling (BIM) management for civil engineering: The aim of this course is to familiarize the students with appropriate skill levels and competency in using BIM technology since the HKSAR Government decreed that BIM technology must be used in the design and construction of all major government capital works projects with a project cost estimate of more than HK$30 million. In this course, students are expected to understand and appreciate the importance of BIM and digital information management in the construction industry and could well prepare themselves for an engineering career.\",\n",
    "    \"Artificial intelligence in civil engineering: This course is designed to equip students with the knowledge of widely used data analytical skills and artificial intelligence algorithms and their applications in real-world civil engineering problems. This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive exposition of artificial intelligence approaches that are useful for solving real-world data analytic problems in civil engineering, particularly transportation engineering. Topics will include linear regression models, logistic regression models, decision trees, ensemble learning, deep learning approaches and unsupervised learning methods. Software packages such as Python will be used to support the demonstration of practical civil engineering applications in the course.\",\n",
    "    \"Applied deep learning for civil engineers: This course is designed to introduce a wide range of topics from basic data science concepts to deep learning algorithms to students in civil engineering. The course differs from other AI and data science courses by focusing on applications for solving construction and structural engineering problems. This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of deep learning and data science and their construction and structural engineering applications for civil engineers. The course topics include exploratory data analysis; data processing techniques; deep learning-based computer vision applications for civil structures; generative AI algorithms for civil applications; transformers, large language models and embodied AI for civil applications.
