      "  \"Statistics and mathematical analysis for biomedical engineering: The ability to understand the fundamentals of biostatistics and to employ appropriate and quantitative statistical methods to analyze data generated from biomedical studies of different designs is a necessary requirement for biomedical engineering students. This is particularly important in their senior years when they are conducting their final year projects with first hand data to analyze. This course introduces the principles, concepts and methodologies of statistical planning and analysis for biomedical studies. Firstly, basic principles including probability, sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, statistical errors and power will be briefly reviewed using examples extracted from biomedical studies. Secondly, commonly used statistical tests, both parametric and non-parametric, including those for comparison studies such as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and association studies such as regression and correlation, will be introduced. Thirdly, practical data management and statistical analyses for biomedical data will be conducted through learning the statistical software \\(R\\). Finally, some special topics useful for biomedical studies such as sample size planning, power analysis, sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic and screening tests, will be covered. Mathematical description and computational modeling of physiological systems has been a vastly growing field. The second part of the course thus introduces quantitative, engineering approaches to human physiology. Three major physiologic systems of the human body (nervous, circulatory, and skeletal) will be studied to exemplify the quantitative nature of human physiology. Well-established mathematical models, including the Hodgkin Huxley model, the cable equation, pressure-volume relationship, and the Hill model, will be elucidated. We will familiarize the students with the MATLAB programming language to set up and solve governing (linear system and differential) equations and to analyze the output in response to input variables. We will also provide the students with a Python programming exercise to build a lightweight convolutional neural network to solve the blood flow velocity field. At the end of the course, the students should have fundamental knowledge and natural mathematical/computational capability of investigating biomedical engineering problems beyond the physiological systems studied in this course.\",\n"
