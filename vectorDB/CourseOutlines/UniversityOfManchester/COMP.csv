1,COMP11120,"Mathematical Techniques for Computer Science: This course covers the fundamental maths required by Computer Science students in order to successfully complete the reminder of their courses as well as for a career in computer science. Topics covered include complex numbers, logic, probability, recursion and induction, relations, vectors, matrices and transformations. This is a full year course that focuses on areas of mathematics required to model and analyse the kind of problems that arise in computer science. Probabilities are used for example in artificial intelligence, and play a vital role in machine learning, while the combinatorics required here also plays a role in the field of computational complexity. Vectors and matrices are the mathematical model underlying computer graphics. Logic is a tool used to reason about computer programs as well as the real world. Recursion is an important programming principle that comes with an associated proof rule, and other mathematical notions such as functions and relations are used routinely in computer science, for example when talking about database systems. Theoretical computer science can be considered an area of mathematics, and the unit also provides an introduction to the fundamental notions of this area. Specifically the unit aims to - introduce mathematical notions relevant to computer science and their applications; - illustrate how abstraction allows the formulation and proof of properties for real-world and computational phenomena, and enable students to apply this technique; - give an understanding and some practice in the fundamental notion of proof.",Manchester (University of),United Kingdom,Computer Science,Computer Science,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/international/study-abroad-exchange/unit-search/COMP11120/

5,COMP15111,"Fundamentals of Computer Architecture: The module introduces Fundamental concepts involved in Computer Architecture, which is the study and design of Computer Systems. Among others, the module discusses architecture terminology (how do we talk about computer systems), models (how do we think about computer systems), topologies (how are computers structured), how programs are executed by the hardware, and how data (whether numbers, text, colours, or polygons) are represented in hardware using only binary digits. Understanding the Fundamentals of Computer Architecture is essential for being able to reason about what exactly happens when we run a program. This is important not just for hardware designers and low level (Operating System, embedded) software developers, but for everyone that wants to create high performing, but still correct, software. As such, it is an increasingly important skill in Computer Science roles in business and finance. More generally, demystifying Computer Systems gives students a strong competitive advantage relative to developers that have no concept of what their code does, whether these developers are human ones or AI models. This unit aims to introduce computer instruction sets and the binary representation of information, by exploring the relationship between high-level language programs and the basic structure and operation of digital computers, including the process that implements this relationship.

The Visual Computing theme consists of the following course units: • Year 2: Computer Graphics and Image Processing (10 credits) • Year 3: Advanced Computer Graphics (10 credits) • Year 3: Computer Vision (10 credits).

26,COMP33312,"Agile Software Pipelines: The approach to software development known as 'agile software engineering' is now well established within the industry as the most reliable and cost-effective in all but a handful of rarely occurring circumstances. Agile approaches emphasise the early and frequent delivery of releasable software artefacts to the client, combined with disciplined but flexible approaches to project progress tracking, to the continuous and active collection of feedback on the success (or otherwise) of the work done so far and to the creation of high-quality code bases that are easy and safe to change. In an agile project, the first usable executable artefacts will be created very early in the project's lifetime and may be in active use while other parts of the required functionality are still in various stages of development. New and changed functionality is delivered incrementally at short intervals throughout the duration of the project, blurring the distinction between the development and the operational project phases. While the human processes used to manage and carry out agile software engineering are highly iterative, the artefacts produced by the processes are increasingly viewed as passing through one or more linear 'pipelines', on their journey to deployment and use in the end-user environment. New models for the delivery of software (such as continuous delivery) depend upon a carefully configured technical pipeline as much as they do upon effective and efficient human design and feedback processes. In this course unit, we will examine how the combination of these iterative human processes and technical development and delivery pipelines is used to create software that provides real value and return on investment for clients and end-users, while also being of sufficiently high quality to allow frequent and sometimes substantial changes throughout the software's lifetime. The unit aims to: Provide you with a working understanding of software pipelines, their use in the development, delivering and operation of software systems, and the iterative and incremental human processes through which they are managed.",Manchester (University of),United Kingdom,Computer Science,Computer Science,https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/international/study-abroad-exchange/unit-search/COMP33312/
